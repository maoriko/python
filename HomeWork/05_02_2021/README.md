#### Push - Insert a new item to the stack.
#### Pop - Remove the last item in the stack.
#### Top - Checks the next value to pop.
#### IsEmpty - Checks if the stack empty.
#### setSize - Will update the maximum value of the stack. 
#### stackAddition - Chain two stack together.
#### stackPrint - Will print the stack values.


# Practice 1
## Implement a stack with an array:

### Create a class named Stack and implement the constructor of the class.
### Implement all the functions in the above structure.
### The stack can hold only integers!.
### The stack will be limited and no items can be inserted.
#### Example: if the maximum size of the stack is five, so the stack can hold only 5, if you try to add more numbers to it, you won't be able to.
### Validate proper action make sure that the program won't crash.
#### Example: When you try to pop, and the stack is empty, or when we try to insert non integer.
