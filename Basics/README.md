practice 1 - 3 are the very first steps of python:
The basics of operators:

# Python Arithmetic Operators
 
Operator | Name | Example 
| --- | --- | --- |   
| + | Addition |x + y|
| - | Subtraction | x - y |
| * | Multiplication | x * y|
| / | Division | x / y |
| % | Modulus | x % y |
| ** | Exponentiation | x ** y |
| // | Floor division | x // y |


# Python Assignment Operators

|Operator|Example| Same As|
|---|---|---|
|=	|x = 5|x = 5	
|+=	|x += 3|x = x + 3	
|-=	|x -= 3|x = x - 3	
|*=	|x *= 3	|x = x * 3	
|/=	|x /= 3	|x = x / 3	
|%=	|x %= 3	|x = x % 3	
|//=| x //= 3|	x = x // 3	
|**=| x **= 3|x = x ** 3	
|&=	| x &= 3 |x = x & 3	
|=x |x |= 3	 |x = x | 3	
|^=	x| ^= 3	|x = x ^ 3	
|>>=|x >>= 3|x = x >> 3	
|<<=|x <<= 3|x = x << 3

# Python Comparison Operators

|Operator|Name|Example|
|---|---|---|
|==|Equal|x == y|
|!=|Not Equal|x != y|
|>| Greater than|x > y|
|<| Less Than| x < y|
|>=|Greater than or equal to| x >= y|
|<=|Less than or equal to|x <= y|

# Python Logical Operators

|Operator|Name|Example|
|---|---|---|
|and|Returns True if both statements are true|	x < 5 and  x < 10|
|or|Returns True if one of the statements is true|	x < 5 or x < 4|
|not|Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true|not ( x < 5 and x < 10 )|

## Practice

1. Write a program with 2 variables num1, num2 with value for your choice,
   and one variable to hold the result whom get the sum of the 2 variables you put before.
   print the text the result is: and then the result.
   

2. Create a progrem and check if the input is greater the number 10 if true print:
   The number greater then 10 else:
   the number you entered is smaller then 10.


3. Create a program whom gets 2 inputs from user,
   if the sum is positive print: 
   the num is positive,
   if the sum is negative so the output should be printed.


4. Write a program whom accepts 2 values from user:
   User want to enter to a roller coaster, his age must be between 8-18 and height myst ne above 115CM if the user is above 18 the height must be above 110CM
